# The_WeRateDogs_Twitter_Archive
This is Udacity project 2. In this project I was given the task of wrangling data from a selection of archived tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter account. The data for this project is contained in the following files:  

twitter-archive-enhanced.csv: the archived tweets. 

image-predictions.tsv: prediction results from a machine learning algorithm trained on a sample of the archived tweets. 

tweet_json.txt: the extra data obtained from Twitter.

The cleaned data is contained in the file twitter-archive-master.csv

Also note the following files:

wrangle_act.html: Details the data wrangling process.

wrangle_report.html: Briefly summarizes my experiences wrangling the data for this project.

act_report.pdf: report on the insights that I found in the data.

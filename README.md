# The_WeRateDogs_Twitter_Archive
This is Udacity project 2. In this project I was given the task of wrangling data from a selection of archived tweets from the WeRateDogs twitter account. The data for this project is contained in the following files:  twitter-archive-enhanced.csv: the archived tweets. image-predictions.tsv: prediction results from a machine learning algorithm trained on a sample of the archived tweets. tweet_json.txt: the extra data obtained from Twitter.
